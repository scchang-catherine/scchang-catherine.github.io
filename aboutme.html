<br>
<br>
My name is Catherine Chang, and I am currently a second year at UC Berkeley. I grew up in the heart of Silicon Valley, in Cupertino, California, but I actually traveled back and forth between Taiwan and America when I was younger because my parents wanted me to learn Chinese. 
<br>
<br>
I am a second year computer science major, and my interests lie somewhere between UI/UX design and product management. I aspire to find ways to effectively combine computer science, business marketing, and digital aesthetics to promote the development of meaningful connections between people and improve lifestyle convenience.
<br>
<br>
In my spare time, I like to play the piano, learn how to cook, and watch fashion and makeup tutorials on YouTube. I have a guilty pleasure of eating ice cream by the heater in the wintertime. I also have an obsession with the color white and swimmingpool blue. You can find them all over my designs.
